# To run frontend and backend:
1. Make sure you have node and pip installed, we will be using npm which should come with node
2. Go to server subdirectory, run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. Travel back to project root and go to client subdirectory, run ``npm i``
4. Travel back to project root, run ``npm i`` again
5. Run ``npm run dev`` to run both at the same time
